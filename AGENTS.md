top level imports to use 

```ts
import '@pixi/layout' // Import layout before PixiJS to ensure mixins are applied
import '@pixi/react';
import '@pixi/layout/react';

import { LayoutContainer } from '@pixi/layout/components'
import { Application, extend } from '@pixi/react'
import { Container, Graphics, Text } from 'pixi.js'



// Extend @pixi/react with PIXI components
extend({ Container, Graphics, Text, LayoutContainer })

# github


you can use the `gh` cli to do operations on github for the current repository. For example: open issues, open PRs, check actions status, read workflow logs, etc.

## creating issues and pull requests

when opening issues and pull requests with gh cli, never use markdown headings or sections. instead just use simple paragraphs, lists and code examples. be as short as possible while remaining clear and using good English.

example:

```bash
gh issue create --title "Fix login timeout" --body "The login form times out after 5 seconds on slow connections. This affects users on mobile networks.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open login page on 3G connection
2. Enter credentials
3. Click submit

Expected: Login completes within 30 seconds
Actual: Request times out after 5 seconds

Error in console:
\`\`\`bash
Error: Request timeout at /api/auth/login
\`\`\`"
```

## get current github repo

`git config --get remote.origin.url`

## checking status of latest github actions workflow run

```bash
gh run list # lists latest actions runs
gh run watch <id> --exit-status # if workflow is in progress, wait for the run to complete. the actions run is finished when this command exits. Set a tiemout of at least 10 minutes when running this command
gh pr checks --watch --fail-fast # watch for current branch pr ci checks to finish
gh run view <id> --log-failed | tail -n 300 # read the logs for failed steps in the actions run
gh run view <id> --log | tail -n 300 # read all logs for a github actions run
```

## responding to PR reviews and comments (gh-pr-review extension)

```bash
# view reviews and get thread IDs
gh pr-review review view 42 -R owner/repo --unresolved

# reply to a review comment
gh pr-review comments reply 42 -R owner/repo \
  --thread-id PRRT_kwDOAAABbcdEFG12 \
  --body "Fixed in latest commit"

# resolve a thread
gh pr-review threads resolve 42 -R owner/repo --thread-id PRRT_kwDOAAABbcdEFG12
```

## reading github repos source code

```sh
opensrc zod # npm package name

# Using github: prefix
opensrc github:owner/repo

# Using owner/repo shorthand
opensrc facebook/react

# Using full GitHub URL
opensrc https://github.com/colinhacks/zod

# Fetch a specific branch or tag
opensrc owner/repo@v1.0.0
opensrc owner/repo#main

# Mix packages and repos
```

This will download the source code in ./opensrc. which should be put in .gitignore


Use tmux to run long-lived background commands as background “tasks” like vite dev servers, commands with watch mode.  
Each task should be a tmux **session** that the agent can start, inspect, and stop via CLI.

ALWAYS give long and descriptive names for the sessions, so other agents know what they are for.

Run a background task (e.g. Vite dev server) without blocking:

```bash
tmux new-session -d -s project-name-vite-dev-port-8034 'cd /path/to/project && npm run dev --port 8034'
```

Every time you are about to start a new session, first check if there is one already.

List all background tasks (sessions):

```bash
tmux ls
```

You can assume sessions that do not have names were not started by you or agents so you can ignore them

Kill a background task:

```bash
tmux kill-session -t vite-dev
```

Never attach to a session. You are inside a non TTY terminal, meaning you instead will have to read the latest n logs instead.


Fetch the last N log lines for a task without attaching (returns immediately):

```bash
tmux capture-pane -t vite-dev:0 -S -100 -p
```

Example pattern for a coding agent:

1. Start a task:

   ```bash
   tmux new-session -d -s build 'cd /repo && npm run build'
   ```

2. Poll logs:

   ```bash
   tmux capture-pane -t build:0 -S -80 -p
   ```

3. List all running tasks:

   ```bash
   tmux ls
   ```

4. Stop a task when done:

   ```bash
   tmux kill-session -t build
   ```

# core guidelines

when summarizing changes at the end of the message, be super short, a few words and in bullet points, use bold text to highlight important keywords. use markdown.

please ask questions and confirm assumptions before generating complex architecture code.

NEVER run commands with & at the end to run them in the background. this is leaky and harmful! instead ask me to run commands in the background using tmux if needed.

NEVER commit yourself unless asked to do so. I will commit the code myself.

NEVER use git to revert files to previous state if you did not create those files yourself! there can be user changes in files you touched, if you revert those changes the user will be very upset!

## files

always use kebab case for new filenames. never use uppercase letters in filenames

never write temporary files to /tmp. instead write them to a local ./tmp folder instead. make sure it is in .gitignore too

## see files in the repo

use `git ls-files | tree --fromfile` to see files in the repo. this command will ignore files ignored by git

## handling unexpected file contents after a read or write

if you find code that was not there since the last time you read the file it means the user or another agent edited the file. do not revert the changes that were added. instead keep them and integrate them with your new changes

IMPORTANT: NEVER commit your changes unless clearly and specifically asked to!

## opening me files in zed to show me a specific portion of code

you can open files when i ask me "open in zed the line where ..." using the command `zed path/to/file:line`

# typescript

- ALWAYS use normal imports instead of dynamic imports, unless there is an issue with es module only packages and you are in a commonjs package (this is rare).
- when throwing errors always use clause instead of error inside message: `new Error("wrapping error", { cause: e })` instead of `new Error(\`wrapping error ${e}\`)`

- use a single object argument instead of multiple positional args: use object arguments for new typescript functions if the function would accept more than one argument, so it is more readable, ({a,b,c}) instead of (a,b,c). this way you can use the object as a sort of named argument feature, where order of arguments does not matter and it's easier to discover parameters.

- always add the {} block body in arrow functions: arrow functions should never be written as `onClick={(x) => setState('')}`. NEVER. instead you should ALWAYS write `onClick={() => {setState('')}}`. this way it's easy to add new statements in the arrow function without refactoring it.

- in array operations .map, .filter, .reduce and .flatMap are preferred over .forEach and for of loops. For example prefer doing `.push(...array.map(x => x.items))` over mutating array variables inside for loops. Always think of how to turn for loops into expressions using .map, .filter or .flatMap if you ever are about to write a for loop.

- if you encounter typescript errors like "undefined | T is not assignable to T" after .filter(Boolean) operations: use a guarded function instead of Boolean: `.filter(isTruthy)`. implemented as `function isTruthy<T>(value: T): value is NonNullable<T> { return Boolean(value) }`

- minimize useless comments: do not add useless comments if the code is self descriptive. only add comments if requested or if this was a change that i asked for, meaning it is not obvious code and needs some inline documentation. if a comment is required because the part of the code was result of difficult back and forth with me, keep it very short.

- ALWAYS add all information encapsulated in my prompt to comments: when my prompt is super detailed and in depth, all this information should be added to comments in your code. this is because if the prompt is very detailed it must be the fruit of a lot of research. all this information would be lost if you don't put it in the code. next LLM calls would misinterpret the code and miss context.

- NEVER write comments that reference changes between previous and old code generated between iterations of our conversation. do that in prompt instead. comments should be used for information of the current code. code that is deleted does not matter.

- use early returns (and breaks in loops): do not nest code too much. follow the go best practice of if statements: avoid else, nest as little as possible, use top level ifs. minimize nesting. instead of doing `if (x) { if (b) {} }` you should do `if (x && b) {};` for example. you can always convert multiple nested ifs or elses into many linear ifs at one nesting level. use the @think tool for this if necessary.

- typecheck after updating code: after any change to typescript code ALWAYS run the `pnpm typecheck` script of that package, or if there is no typecheck script run `pnpm tsc` yourself

- do not use any: you must NEVER use any. if you find yourself using `as any` or `:any`, use the @think tool to think hard if there are types you can import instead. do even a search in the project for what the type could be. any should be used as a last resort.

- NEVER do `(x as any).field` or `'field' in x` before checking if the code compiles first without it. the code probably doesn't need any or the in check. even if it does not compile, use think tool first! before adding (x as any).something, ALWAYS read the .d.ts to understand the types

- do not declare uninitialized variables that are defined later in the flow. instead use an IIFE with returns. this way there is less state. also define the type of the variable before the iife. here is an example:

- use || over in: avoid 'x' in obj checks. prefer doing `obj?.x || ''` over doing `'x' in obj ? obj.x : ''`. only use the in operator if that field causes problems in typescript checks because typescript thinks the field is missing, as a last resort.

- when creating urls from a path and a base url, prefer using `new URL(path, baseUrl).toString()` instead of normal string interpolation. use type-safe react-router `href` or spiceflow `this.safePath` (available inside routes) if possible

- for node built-in imports, never import singular exported names. instead do `import fs from 'node:fs'`, same for path, os, etc.

- NEVER start the development server with pnpm dev yourself. there is no reason to do so, even with &

- When creating classes do not add setters and getters for a simple private field. instead make the field public directly so user can get it or set it himself without abstractions on top

- if you encounter typescript lint errors for an npm package, read the node_modules/package/\*.d.ts files to understand the typescript types of the package. if you cannot understand them, ask me to help you with it.

- NEVER silently suppress errors in catch {} blocks if they contain more than one function call
```ts
// BAD. DO NOT DO THIS
let favicon: string | undefined;
if (docsConfig?.favicon) {
  if (typeof docsConfig.favicon === "string") {
    favicon = docsConfig.favicon;
  } else if (docsConfig.favicon?.light) {
    // Use light favicon as default, could be enhanced with theme detection
    favicon = docsConfig.favicon.light;
  }
}
// DO THIS. use an iife. Immediately Invoked Function Expression
const favicon: string = (() => {
  if (!docsConfig?.favicon) {
    return "";
  }
  if (typeof docsConfig.favicon === "string") {
    return docsConfig.favicon;
  }
  if (docsConfig.favicon?.light) {
    // Use light favicon as default, could be enhanced with theme detection
    return docsConfig.favicon.light;
  }
  return "";
})();
// if you already know the type use it:
const favicon: string = () => {
  // ...
};
```

- when a package has to import files from another packages in the workspace never add a new tsconfig path, instead add that package as a workspace dependency using `pnpm i "package@workspace:*"`

NEVER use require. always esm imports

always try to use non-relative imports. each package has an absolute import with the package name, you can find it in the tsconfig.json paths section. for example, paths inside website can be imported from website. notice these paths also need to include the src directory.

this is preferable to other aliases like @/ because i can easily move the code from one package to another without changing the import paths. this way you can even move a file and import paths do not change much.

always specify the type when creating arrays, especially for empty arrays. if you don't, typescript will infer the type as `never[]`, which can cause type errors when adding elements later.

**Example:**

```ts
// BAD: Type will be never[]
const items = [];

// GOOD: Specify the expected type
const items: string[] = [];
const numbers: number[] = [];
const users: User[] = [];
```

remember to always add the explicit type to avoid unexpected type inference.

- when using nodejs APIs like fs always import the module and not the named exports. I prefer hacing nodejs APIs accessed on the module namspace like fs, os, path, etc.

DO `import fs from 'fs'; fs.writeFileSync(...)`
DO NOT `import { writeFileSync } from 'fs';`

- NEVER pass a string to abortController.abort(). instead if you want to pass a reason always pass an Error instance. like `controller.abort(new Error('reason'))`. This way catch blocks receive an Error instance and not something else.

# package manager: pnpm with workspace

this project uses pnpm workspaces to manage dependencies. important scripts are in the root package.json or various packages' package.json

try to run commands inside the package folder that you are working on. for example you should never run `pnpm test` from the root

if you need to install packages always use pnpm

instead of adding packages directly in package.json use `pnpm install package` inside the right workspace folder. NEVER manually add a package by updating package.json

## updating a package

when i ask you to update a package always run `pnpm update -r packagename`. to update to latest also add --latest

Do not do `pnpm add packagename` to update a package. only to add a missing one. otherwise other packages versions will get out of sync.

## fixing duplicate pnpm dependencies

sometimes typescript will fail if there are 2 duplicate packages in the workspace node_modules. this can happen in pnpm if a package is used in 2 different places (even if inside a node_module package, transitive dependency) with a different set of versions for a peer dependency

for example if better-auth depends on zod peer dep and zod is in different versions in 2 dependency subtrees

to identify if a pnpm package is duplicated, search for the string " packagename@" inside `pnpm-lock.yaml`, notice the space in the search string. then if the result returns multiple instances with a different set of peer deps inside the round brackets, it means that this package is being duplicated. here is an example of a package getting duplicated:

```

  better-auth@1.3.6(react-dom@19.1.1(react@19.1.1))(react@19.1.1)(zod@3.25.76):
    dependencies:
      '@better-auth/utils': 0.2.6
      '@better-fetch/fetch': 1.1.18
      '@noble/ciphers': 0.6.0
      '@noble/hashes': 1.8.0
      '@simplewebauthn/browser': 13.1.2
      '@simplewebauthn/server': 13.1.2
      better-call: 1.0.13
      defu: 6.1.4
      jose: 5.10.0
      kysely: 0.28.5
      nanostores: 0.11.4
      zod: 3.25.76
    optionalDependencies:
      react: 19.1.1
      react-dom: 19.1.1(react@19.1.1)

  better-auth@1.3.6(react-dom@19.1.1(react@19.1.1))(react@19.1.1)(zod@4.0.17):
    dependencies:
      '@better-auth/utils': 0.2.6
      '@better-fetch/fetch': 1.1.18
      '@noble/ciphers': 0.6.0
      '@noble/hashes': 1.8.0
      '@simplewebauthn/browser': 13.1.2
      '@simplewebauthn/server': 13.1.2
      better-call: 1.0.13
      defu: 6.1.4
      jose: 5.10.0
      kysely: 0.28.5
      nanostores: 0.11.4
      zod: 4.0.17
    optionalDependencies:
      react: 19.1.1
      react-dom: 19.1.1(react@19.1.1)

```

as you can see, better-auth is listed twice with different sets of peer deps. in this case it's because of zod being in version 3 and 4 in two subtrees of our workspace dependencies.

as a first step, try running `pnpm dedupe better-auth` with your package name and see if there is still the problem.

below i will describe how to generally deduplicate a package. i will use zod as an example. it works with any dependency found in the previous step.

to deduplicate the package, we have to make sure we only have 1 version of zod installed in your workspace. DO NOT use overrides for this. instead, fix the problem by manually updating the dependencies that are forcing the older version of zod in the dependency tree.

to do so, we first have to run the command `pnpm -r why zod@3.25.76` to see the reason the older zod version is installed. in this case, the result is something like this:

```

website /Users/morse/Documents/GitHub/holocron/website (PRIVATE)

dependencies:
@better-auth/stripe 1.2.10
├─┬ better-auth 1.3.6
│ └── zod 3.25.76 peer
└── zod 3.25.76
db link:../db
└─┬ docs-website link:../docs-website
  ├─┬ fumadocs-docgen 2.0.1
  │ └── zod 3.25.76
  ├─┬ fumadocs-openapi link:../fumadocs/packages/openapi
  │ └─┬ @modelcontextprotocol/sdk 1.17.3
  │   ├── zod 3.25.76
  │   └─┬ zod-to-json-schema 3.24.6
  │     └── zod 3.25.76 peer
  └─┬ searchapi link:../searchapi
    └─┬ agents 0.0.109
      ├─┬ @modelcontextprotocol/sdk 1.17.3
      │ ├── zod 3.25.76
      │ └─┬ zod-to-json-schema 3.24.6
      │   └── zod 3.25.76 peer
      └─┬ ai 4.3.19
        ├─┬ @ai-sdk/provider-utils 2.2.8
        │ └── zod 3.25.76 peer
        └─┬ @ai-sdk/react 1.2.12
          ├─┬ @ai-sdk/provider-utils 2.2.8
          │ └── zod 3.25.76 peer
          └─┬ @ai-sdk/ui-utils 1.2.11
            └─┬ @ai-sdk/provider-utils 2.2.8
              └── zod 3.25.76 peer
```

here we can see zod 3 is installed because of @modelcontextprotocol/sdk, @better-auth/stripe and agents packages. to fix the problem, we can run

```
pnpm update -r --latest  @modelcontextprotocol/sdk @better-auth/stripe agents
```

this way, if these packages include the newer version of the dependency, zod will be deduplicated automatically.

in this case, we could have only updated @better-auth/stripe to fix the issue too, that's because @better-auth/stripe is the one that has better-auth as a peer dep. but finding what is the exact problematic package is difficult, so it is easier to just update all packages you notice that we depend on directly in our workspace package.json files.

if after doing this we still have duplicate packages, you will have to ask the user for help. you can try deleting the node_modules and restarting the approach, but it rarely helps.

# react

- never test react code. instead put as much code as possible in react-agnostic functions or classes and test those if needed.

- hooks, all functions that start with use, MUST ALWAYS be called in the component render scope, never inside other closures in the component or event handlers. follow react rules of hooks.

- always put all hooks at the start of component functions. put hooks that are bigger and longer later if possible. all other non-hooks logic should go after hooks section, things like conditionals, expressions, etc

## react code

- `useEffect` is bad: the use of useEffect is discouraged. please do not use it unless strictly necessary. before using useEffect call the @think tool to make sure that there are no other options. usually you can colocate code that runs inside useEffect to the functions that call that useEffect dependencies setState instead

- too many `useState` calls are bad. if some piece of state is dependent on other state just compute it as an expression in render. do not add new state unless strictly necessary. before adding a new useState to a component, use @think tool to think hard if you can instead: use expression with already existing local state, use expression with some global state, use expression with loader data, use expression with some other existing variable instead. for example if you need to show a popover when there is an error you should use the error as open state for the popover instead of adding new useState hook

- `useCallback` is bad. it should be always avoided unless for ref props. ref props ALWAYS need to be passed memoized functions or the component could remount on ever render!

- NEVER pass functions to useEffect or useMemo dependencies. when you start passing functions to hook dependencies you need to add useCallback everywhere in the code, useCallback is a virus that infects the codebase and should be ALWAYS avoided.

- custom hooks are bad. NEVER add custom hooks unless asked to do so by me. instead of creating hooks create generic react-independent functions. every time you find yourself creating a custom hook call @think and think hard if you can just create a normal function instead, or just inline the expression in the component if small enough

- minimize number of props. do not use props if you can use zustand state instead. the app has global zustand state that lets you get a piece of state down from the component tree by using something like `useStore(x => x.something)` or `useLoaderData<typeof loader>()` or even useRouteLoaderData if you are deep in the react component tree

- do not consider local state truthful when interacting with server. when interacting with the server with rpc or api calls never use state from the render function as input for the api call. this state can easily become stale or not get updated in the closure context. instead prefer using zustand `useStore.getState().stateValue`. notice that useLoaderData or useParams should be fine in this case.

- when using useRef with a generic type always add undefined in the call, for example `useRef<number>(undefined)`. this is required by the react types definitions

- when using && in jsx make sure that the result type is not of type number. in that case add Boolean() wrapper. this way jsx will not show zeros when the value is falsy.

## components

- place new components in the src/components folder. shadcn components will go to the src/components/ui folder, usually they are not manually updated but added with the shadcn cli (which is preferred to be run without npx, either with pnpm or globally just shadcn)

- component filenames should follow kebab case structure

- do not create a new component file if this new code will only be used in another component file. only create a component file if the component is used by multiple components or routes. colocate related components in the same file.

- non component code should be put in the src/lib folder.

- hooks should be put in the src/hooks.tsx file. do not create a new file for each new hook. also notice that you should never create custom hooks, only do it if asked for.

## zustand

zustand is the preferred way to created global React state. put it in files like state.ts or x-state.ts where x is something that describe a portion of app state in case of multiple global states or multiple apps

- NEVER add zustand state setter methods. instead use useStore.setState to set state. For example never add a method `setVariable` in the state type. Instead call `setState` directly

- zustand already merges new partial state with the previous state. NEVER DO `useStore.setState({ ...useStore.getInitialState(), ... })` unless for resetting state

## non controlled input components

some components do not have a value prop to set the value via React state. these are called uncontrolled components. Instead they usually let you get the current input value via ref. something like ref.current.value. They usually also have an onChange prop that let you know when the value changes

these usually have a initialValue or defaultValue to programmatically set the initial value of the input

when using these components you SHOULD not track their state via React: instead you should programmatically set their value and read their value via refs in event handlers

tracking uncontrolled inputs via React state means that you will need to add useEffect to programmatically change their value when our state changes. this is an anti pattern. instead you MUST keep in mind the uncontrolled input manages its own state and we interface with it via refs and initialValue prop. 

using React state in these cases is only necessary if you have to show the input value during render. if that is not the case you can just use `inputRef.current.value` instead and set the value via `inputRef.current.value = something`

# testing

.toMatchInlineSnapshot is the preferred way to write tests. leave them empty the first time, update them with -u. check git diff for the test file every time you update them with -u

never use timeouts longer than 5 seconds for expects and other statements timeouts. increase timeouts for tests if required, up to 1 minute

do not create dumb tests that test nothing. do not write tests if there is not already a test file or describe block for that function or module.

if the inputs for the tests is an array of repetitive fields and long content, generate this input data programmatically instead of hardcoding everything. only hardcode the important parts and generate other repetitive fields in a .map or .reduce

tests should validate complex and non-obvious logic. if a test looks like a placeholder, do not add it.

use vitest or bun test to run tests. tests should be run from the current package directory and not root. try using the test script instead of vitest directly. additional vitest flags can be added at the end, like --run to disable watch mode or -u to update snapshots.

to understand how the code you are writing works, you should add inline snapshots in the test files with expect().toMatchInlineSnapshot(), then run the test with `pnpm test -u --run` or `pnpm vitest -u --run` to update the snapshot in the file, then read the file again to inspect the result. if the result is not expected, update the code and repeat until the snapshot matches your expectations. never write the inline snapshots in test files yourself. just leave them empty and run `pnpm test -u --run` to update them.

> always call `pnpm vitest` or `pnpm test` with `--run` or they will hang forever waiting for changes!
> ALWAYS read back the test if you use the `-u` option to make sure the inline snapshots are as you expect.

- NEVER write the snapshots content yourself in `toMatchInlineSnapshot`. instead leave it as is and call `pnpm test -u` to fill in snapshots content. the first time you call `toMatchInlineSnapshot()` you can leave it empty

- when updating implementation and `toMatchInlineSnapshot` should change, DO NOT remove the inline snapshots yourself, just run `pnpm test -u` instead! This will replace contents of the snapshots without wasting time doing it yourself.

- for very long snapshots you should use `toMatchFileSnapshot(filename)` instead of `toMatchInlineSnapshot()`. put the snapshot files in a snapshots/ directory and use the appropriate extension for the file based on the content

never test client react components. only React and browser independent code. 

most tests should be simple calls to functions with some expect calls, no mocks. test files should be called the same as the file where the tested function is being exported from.

NEVER use mocks. the database does not need to be mocked, just use it. simply do not test functions that mutate the database if not asked.

tests should strive to be as simple as possible. the best test is a simple `.toMatchInlineSnapshot()` call. these can be easily evaluated by reading the test file after the run passing the -u option. you can clearly see from the inline snapshot if the function behaves as expected or not.

try to use only describe and test in your tests. do not use beforeAll, before, etc if not strictly required.

NEVER write tests for react components or react hooks. NEVER write tests for react components. you will be fired if you do.

sometimes tests work directly on database data, using prisma. to run these tests you have to use the package.json script, which will call `doppler run -- vitest` or similar. never run doppler cli yourself as you could delete or update production data. tests generally use a staging database instead.

never write tests yourself that call prisma or interact with database or emails. for these, ask the user to write them for you.

# changesets

After completing a fix or feature for a **public package** (has `version` in package.json, not `private: true`), add a changeset file in `.changeset/` at the repo root. Never edit CHANGELOG.md directly; it is generated automatically at publish time when changesets are consumed.

Never run the `changeset` CLI command interactively. Always create the file manually.

Create a `.md` file with a random kebab-case name (e.g. `cool-lions-dance.md`):

```md
---
'package-name': patch
---

Description of what changed, with code examples if applicable.
```

Multiple packages can be listed in one changeset:

```md
---
'spiceflow': minor
'create-spiceflow': patch
---

Add federation support for remote RSC components.
```

## rules

- **Never use `major`.** Use `patch` for fixes and `minor` for new features.
- **Never edit CHANGELOG.md directly.** It is generated from changesets at publish time.
- **Never bump `package.json` version manually.** Versions are bumped automatically.
- **Never run the changeset CLI.** Write the `.md` file yourself.
- **Only public packages.** Skip changesets for packages marked `private: true` or without a `version` field.
- **Present tense.** Write "add support for X", "fix bug with Y".
- **One changeset per logical change.** Two unrelated changes get two files.

## rich content

Changeset descriptions become the public changelog. Write them as rich content aimed at end users:

- Code examples showing new APIs or changed behavior
- Migration steps if the user needs to update their code
- Diagrams explaining architecture changes
- Before/after comparisons

## private packages

For **private packages** (`private: true`, no version), skip changesets entirely. These do not get published.

Load the `changesets` skill for full workflow details.

# writing docs

when generating a .md or .mdx file to document things, always add a frontmatter with title and description. also add a prompt field with the exact prompt used to generate the doc. use @ to reference files and urls and provide any context necessary to be able to recreate this file from scratch using a model. if you used urls also reference them. reference all files you had to read to create the doc. use yaml | syntax to add this prompt and never go over the column width of 80
# secrets

this project uses doppler to manage secrets, with a single project with 3 envs: dev, preview and production. dev is the env already selected and implicit in doppler calls.

in typescript never use process.env directly. instead find the closest `env.ts` file that exports an env object (this file should already exist). so the env can be used type-safely and i can clearly see which secrets are available and need to be added.
# zod

when you need to create a complex type that comes from a prisma table, do not create a new schema that tries to recreate the prisma table structure. instead just use `z.any() as ZodType<PrismaTable>)` to get type safety but leave any in the schema. this gets most of the benefits of zod without having to define a new zod schema that can easily go out of sync.

## converting zod schema to jsonschema

you MUST use the built in zod v4 toJSONSchema and not the npm package `zod-to-json-schema` which is outdated and does not support zod v4.

```ts
import { toJSONSchema } from "zod";

const mySchema = z.object({
  id: z.string().uuid(),
  name: z.string().min(3).max(100),
  age: z.number().min(0).optional(),
});

const jsonSchema = toJSONSchema(mySchema, {
  removeAdditionalStrategy: "strict",
});
```
